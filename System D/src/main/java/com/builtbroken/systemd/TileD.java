/**
 * Base class for VE's tile system that combines the Block and Tile class to make implementing
 * new blocks faster. It does have some memory overhead due to the number of fields each class
 * stores. Though the amount of memory used is very little. If it becomes an issue it is recommended to just use
 * the classic Block & TileEntity system from Minecraft. As this will have less memory overhead but will take
 * more work to implement the same functionality.
 * <p/>
 * In order for this class to work it needs to be registered threw the ModManager or something similar. In
 * which a new BlockTile will be created with a static version of this class in it.
 * <p/>
 * Just as a note the system is designed in a special way in order to function. This class will act as a
 * redirect for your Block & Tile. If a method or Field has BLOCK in the java doc it is treated like
 * a static value. If it has the world TILE in the java doc the it is primary directed at the tile instance
 * at the block location. If it can't find the tile it will redirect to the static tile that is your Block.
 * <p/>
